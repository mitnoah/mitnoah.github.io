    <p>The Parramatta Eels are an Australian professional rugby league football club based in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta. The Parramatta District Rugby League Football Club was formed in 1947, and have been living in past glories since 1986 with their First Grade side playing their first season in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiershipâ€™s fortieth season in 1947. Their home ground is Parramatta's Pirtek Stadium.

It took thirty years for the club to make the Grand Final, which they did in 1976 and 1977, losing on both occasions. However, this period foreshadowed their most successful period in the early 1980s, when they won four premierships and qualified for five Grand Finals in six seasons. This was a golden era for the club and yielded their only premiership titles. The club plays in the National Rugby League, the premier rugby league football competition in Australasia. Parramatta sides are also fielded in lower grades and junior competitions run by the New South Wales Rugby League where they regularly win premierships in various grades.</h1>

        Bevan French (born 4 January 1996) is an Australian professional rugby league footballer who currently plays for the Parramatta Eels in the National Rugby League. He plays at fullback and wing. Born in Tingha, New South Wales, French is of Indigenous Australian descent and played his junior rugby league for the Tingha Tigers. At the age of 15, he began playing for Tingha's first-grade team at fullback, playing against men twice his age.[1] French is the nephew of former Australian international and St George Illawarra Dragons winger Nathan Blacklock. Early in 2013, French was pursued by 6 NRL clubs including Parramatta, Melbourne, Newcastle, the Gold Coast, Penrith and St. George Illawarra. He eventually signed for the Parramatta Eels, stating that he chose the club because he "just had a feeling". In 2015 and 2016, he played for the Eels' NYC team.[3] In 2015, he began the season at five-eighth, before moving back to fullback for the remainder of the year, finishing the season with 16 tries in 22 games.[4] On 11 July 2015, he re-signed with the Eels on a 3-year contract to the end of the 2018 season.[5]

2016[edit]
In February, French participated in Eels' 2016 Auckland Nines title win, scoring 8 tries in the tournament, the record for most tries in a Nines tournament.[6] He was also named in the team of the tournament.[7] In Round 12 of the 2016 NRL season, French made his NRL debut against the Newcastle Knights, scoring a try on debut in the Eels' 20-18 win.[8][9] In Round 15 against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, French scored his first double in the Eels 30-12 win at ANZ Stadium.[10] In Round 17 against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, French scored his first hatrick of tries in the Eels 34-24 loss at Shark Park.[11][2]
